How to interpret the London.dat file.

It contain multiple lines.
The first line tell how many node, edge, subway and line on subway there are. ("nbN nbL nbS nbLS")
Note : nbLS is important because some subway got separated line in it so we want to add them separatly
the next nbN lines will contain the node index and it's label.
a node line will be :
"node_index node_label"
after this, the next nbS lines will contain the subway.
a subway line will be :
"line_id nb_stop stop_1_index stop_2_index ... stop_nb_stop_index subway_label"
